VMs provide a good balance of scalability, performance, security, and cost.\n\n\nBenefits of running a Kubernetes cluster on VMs:\n\n",
      "When you deploy a Kubernetes cluster on Bare Metal, you don’t have a hypervisor and guest operating system. Therefore, your containerized applications use the physical server resources directly and fully.\n\n\nBare Metal is the superior choice for compute-intensive web applications that need high performance and lower latency, but don’t require the fastest provisioning for new worker nodes.\n\n\nBenefits of running a Kubernetes cluster on Bare Metal:\n\n",
      "Managed Kubernetes is a service that offers a hosted Kubernetes environment. This means that the managed Kubernetes provider handles the underlying infrastructure, such as provisioning and managing nodes, managing the Kubernetes control plane, and updating Kubernetes itself. This allows customers to focus on building and deploying applications on top of Kubernetes, saving you from worrying about managing the control plane and maintaining the underlying infrastructure.\n\n\nTo learn more about managed services, read our article “What Are Managed Services?”\nFor learning more about Kubernetes, read the article “What Is a Kubernetes Cluster?”",
      "For most organizations, managed Kubernetes is a better choice than self-managed Kubernetes. Running self-managed Kubernetes clusters means you have to do everything yourself:\n\n",
      "There are four key advantages to running a Kubernetes cluster on Bare Metal:\n\n\nPerformance. Clusters running on Bare Metal have no hypervisor overhead, so they can provide better performance than clusters running on virtual machines. This is especially important for applications that require low latency and high throughput.\n\n\nControl. Bare Metal gives you complete control of the underlying infrastructure. This means you can choose the hardware that best suits your needs and configure it accordingly.\n\n\nLatency. When you run a Kubernetes cluster on Bare Metal, you don’t have an extra virtual networking layer. Applications communicate directly over physical network interfaces. As a result, you get lower network latency.\n\n\nSecurity. Utilizing Kubernetes on Bare Metal offers more protection than VMs because there is no shared infrastructure with other users. You have full control over security measures and can apply customized security protocols.\n\n\nRead more about this topic in our article.",
      "No, you can only manage worker nodes. Gcore takes care of the control plane management. One of the benefits of having a managed Kubernetes service is a reduced operational overhead, because you don't have to support master nodes yourself.

      "Gcore Managed Kubernetes supports Ubuntu for VM and Bare Metal worker nodes.",
      "There are no Gcore restrictions for applications and tools already running in Kubernetes, including open-source options. However, there may be restrictions for tools that are managed services that only work with a specific vendor. For example, if you have been using another managed Kubernetes service along with built-in managed logging to collect logs from your clusters, that managed logging may not work with your clusters running in Gcore Managed Kubernetes. Check which of your existing tools have potential limitations for integrating with other managed Kubernetes services.",

Such a worker node costs $37.41 per month with traffic included and no control plane management fee. So your cluster will cost you $74.82 per month.

Generally, managed servers are for those who want to focus on their business and leave server management to the provider. Unmanaged servers are recommended for professionals with the technical expertise to manage the server themselves. Also, unmanaged servers give more control and customization options for the customer.\n\n\nGcore offers unmanaged dedicated servers. To learn more about tools for managing servers, refer to our documentation.",

The choice between them depends on your business needs, budget, and technical expertise.\n\n\nHere are the main differences that should inform your decision:\n\n",
      "Server uptime refers to the duration during which a server is functioning and accessible to users. It’s commonly represented as a percentage, with 100% uptime being the ideal scenario. We guarantee 99.9% uptime for our dedicated servers.\n\n\nServer uptime is important for dedicated servers because businesses often use these servers to run websites and applications around the clock. Any downtime can result in lost revenue, productivity, and customer satisfaction.",
      "Dedicated servers are generally more secure than shared hosting and virtual servers. Dedicated servers are not vulnerable to attacks from other customers or attacks that affect other customers.\n\n\nGcore also provides basic DDoS Protection that protects dedicated servers from DDoS attacks. When a server is attacked, the system blocks its IP, so the attacker cannot continue the attack.\n\n\nYou can also order advanced DDoS Protection, which is paid. The main advantage of advanced DDoS Protection is that the IP is not blocked during an attack, and the server and any application running on it remain available. To learn more about DDoS attacks and how DDoS protection works, read our article.",

The notification will include time and date, duration and description of any such work. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Gcore reasonably believes that timely providing such notice would result in an unacceptable risk of a defect, damage or loss of integrity to the Gcore’s network or equipment, Gcore may perform such work and may serve notice to Customer of the need to perform emergency maintenance on the network or equipment with a notice period reasonable under the given the circumstances.\n\n\n2.9  Irrespective of the actual duration of the usage of a Service by Customer, Gcore charges Customer for the full month of such Service, starting from the calendar month in which such Service was activated.\n\n\n2.10  For the purposes of this Agreement, one Kbps is equal to 1,000 bits; one Mbps is equal to 1,000 Kbps; one Gbps is equal to 1,000 Mbps etc; one KB is equal to 1,000 bytes; one MB is equal to 1,000 KB; one GB is equal to 1,000 MB; one TB is equal to 1,000 GB; one PB is equal to 1,000 TB etc.\n\n\n2.11  Gcore may offer trial versions of the Services free of charge for a specified time period (“Free Service Period”).

For the avoidance of doubt, any Free Service Period shall not extend Initial Subscription Term or Renewal Term unless otherwise specified in the Service Order or expressly indicated in writing by Gcore. Gcore will have no liability for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with any use of the Services during the Free Service Period.\n\n\n2.12  The Free Service Period is intended exclusively for the personal use by private individuals. After the Free Service Period is expired, all data, including Customer Data and/or Customer Content may be permanently erased. Without prejudice to any other provision of this Agreement and/or AUP, during the Free Service Period the Customer is not allowed to:\n\n\n(a) use any Service for serving video or a disproportionate percentage of pictures, audio files, or other non-HTML content (if applicable);\n\n\n(b) use any Service for commercial or professional purpose;\n\n\n(c) resell and/or engage in any sub-contracting of the Services.\n\n\n2.13  Gcore may at its own discretion and without notice change the terms and conditions of the Free Service Period and introduce any restrictions and limitations.\n\n",

This may include changing the alias information in Customer’s DNS record so that hostname addresses of page objects resolve to Gcore’s servers.\n\n\n4.2  Customer acknowledges that the timely and successful performance of Services requires good faith cooperation by the Customer. Therefore, Customer will (a) furnish all information reasonably requested by Gcore, (b) comply with all laws, regulations, orders and statutes which may be applicable to Customer, and (c) timely perform its obligations as necessary to meet any schedule or deadline in the applicable Service Order. In the event that any failure by the Customer to comply with the provisions of this section 4 results in any delay, deficiency or interruption in the performance of Services, Gcore shall not be deemed in breach of the applicable Service Order for such delay and Customer shall be responsible for any costs reasonably incurred by Gcore in addressing and remedying such delay, deficiency or interruption.\n\n\n4.3  The Services provided by Gcore pursuant to this Agreement and under any Service Order shall only be used for purposes assumed under this Agreement, and in accordance with applicable local legislation, rules and regulations.

Gcore may increase the Fees, including fees for Services with subscription terms, during annual price indexation. The maximum increase is the higher of (a) 5% or (b) the CPI index in Luxembourg for the previous year. The notification about the indexation will be made either by e-mail or a notice in Gcore’s systems visible to the Customer. The increase can occur each year on the anniversary of the Service Start Date for a specific Service. For different Services separate Service Start Dates may apply.\n\n\n5.2  All charges are exclusive of Taxes. Customer is solely responsible for all Taxes payable in connection with Services. If Customer provides Gcore with a valid, duly executed tax exemption certificate, Gcore will exempt Customer from Taxes in accordance with the law, effective on the date Gcore receives the exemption certificate. If Customer is required by law to make any deduction or withholding from any payment due hereunder to Gcore, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the gross amount payable by Customer to  Gcore will be increased so that, after any such deduction or withholding for taxes, the net amount received by Gcore will not be less than Gcore would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required.\n\n\n5.3  Upon mutual Acceptance of a Service Order, Gcore will begin billing Customer for MRC as of the Service Start Date. Gcore will bill Customer for MRCs at the beginning of a calendar month for the Services provided in the previous month. Gcore will invoice Customer for any overage and other usage charges, if applicable, the following month the usage occurred.\n\n\n5.4  All Fees will be billed and payable in euros, unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing. Customer will pay all MRCs through the Term, regardless of whether or how much Customer uses the committed Services. If Gcore cannot begin timely delivery of Services for any reason caused by Customer, Gcore nonetheless may, in its sole discretion, begin billing Customer for MRCs as of the Service Start Date. Any Service Credit granted under the SLA for a Downtime will be applied to the next applicable invoice, against any charges for MRCs and/or overages.\n\n\n5.5  Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties, Customer shall pay all invoices within fourteen (14) Days of the invoice date by transferring the invoiced amounts to the bank account designated on the invoice. All invoices may be provided to Customer electronically. In respect of all due and unpaid invoiced amounts, Gcore reserves the right to charge (i) in addition to the legal interest, an interest of one and three-quarters percent (1.75%) per month of all invoiced amounts from the due date as set out above until full and final payment of such amounts and (ii) reasonable collection costs incurred in respect of such unpaid invoiced amounts, including but not limited to reasonable legal expenses.\n\n\n5.6  Prices indicated on the website of Gcore are subject to change. Such changes will not apply retroactively.\n\n",

The time for performance of such obligations shall be extended accordingly.\n\n\n14.3  The Affected Party shall:\n\n\n(a)  as soon as reasonably practicable after the start of the event of Force Majeure but no later than ten (10) Days from its start, notify the other Party in writing of the Force Majeure, the date on which it started, its likely or potential duration, and the effect of the Force Majeure on its ability to perform any of its obligations under the Agreement; and\n\n\n(b)  use all reasonable efforts to mitigate the effect of the Force Majeure event on the performance of its obligations.\n\n\nIf the Force Majeure prevents, hinders or delays the Affected Party’s performance of its obligations for a continuous period of more than six (6) weeks, the Party not affected by the Force Majeure may terminate this Agreement by giving one (1) weeks’ written notice to the Affected Party.\n\n",
      "\n15.1  This Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will remain in effect for the initial period of twelve (12) months, unless another initial subscription period is agreed in the Service Order (“Initial Subscription Term”). The Services will renew automatically for periods equal to the Initial Subscription Period (each, a “Renewal Term”) unless, at least thirty (30) Days before expiration of the Initial Subscription Term or, subsequently, the Renewal Term, either Party provides notice of non-renewal. The Initial Subscription Term and all Renewal Terms are collectively, the “Term”. If the Parties enter into a Service Order that expires after the Term, the Term will be deemed to expire on the same date as such Service Order.\n\n\n15.2  Customer may terminate this Agreement for cause, upon notice to Gcore, if (i) a receiver or administrator is appointed for Gcore or its property; (ii) Gcore makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (iii) Gcore commences, or has commenced against it, proceedings under any bankruptcy, insolvency or debtor’s relief law which are not dismissed within sixty (60) Days; (iv) Gcore is liquidated or dissolved; (v) Gcore ceases to do business or otherwise terminates its business operations; or (vi) Gcore materially breaches this Agreement and such breach continues unremedied for twenty (20) Days after receipt of notice from Customer. For clarity, a Downtime is not grounds to terminate this Agreement for cause; Customer's sole remedy for a Downtime is set forth in the SLA.\n\n\n15.3  Gcore may terminate this Agreement for cause and/or suspend Services upon notice to Customer if (i) a receiver or administrator is appointed for Customer or its property; (ii) Customer makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (iii) Customer commences, or has commenced against it, proceedings under any bankruptcy, insolvency or debtor’s relief law which are not dismissed within sixty (60) Days; (iv) Customer is liquidated or dissolved; (v) Customer ceases to do business or otherwise terminates its business operations; (vi) Customer fails to pay invoiced Fees within thirty (30) Days from the invoice date; (vii) any use of Services, including Customer Content, actually or allegedly infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property Rights or otherwise violates the AUP or any applicable law, regulation or order; or (viii) Customer otherwise materially breaches this Agreement and such breach continues unremedied for twenty (20) Days after receipt of notice from Gcore. Gcore may terminate, interrupt or suspend Service without prior notice if necessary to (1) prevent or protect against fraud, (2) protect Gcore’s personnel, facilities, equipment, network or services, (3) prevent violation of section 10 or infringement upon the rights of others or (4) prevent potential material liability.\n\n\n15.4  Upon expiration or termination of the Agreement for any reason, (i) all rights to access or use Services and any other Gcore Intellectual Property Rights will terminate and Gcore will cease providing same, (ii) Customer will pay to Gcore all Fees accrued but unpaid as of the date of expiration or termination, (iii) all liabilities accrued before the date of expiration or termination will survive and (iv) Customer will return or destroy, and certify in writing to Gcore such destruction of, all copies of Gcore Confidential Information.\n\n\n15.5  If Customer terminates the Agreement or a Service Order, without cause, or if Gcore terminates the Agreement for cause pursuant to section 15.3, Customer will be billed and pay to Gcore an amount equal to Customer’s MRCs multiplied by the number of months remaining in the Term (“Early Termination Fee”). If Customer terminates the Agreement for cause pursuant to subsection 15.2, Customer will not be obligated to pay Early Termination Fee.\n\n\n15.6  In preparing a final invoice to Customer, which Customer will pay pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Gcore will (i) calculate the balance due, (ii) deduct from such balance the unused portion, if any, of any prepaid Fees or Customer deposit and (c) bill Customer for the remaining balance due. If there remains an unused portion of any prepaid Fees or Customer deposit after satisfaction of the balance due, Gcore will refund to Customer such unused portion.\n\n",
      "\n16.1  Gcore may, upon giving notice to Customer, without prejudice to any of Gcore’s rights to terminate this Agreement or any Service Order hereunder, suspend provision of all or any of Services in the event that\n\n\n(a)  suspension of Services is required in order to comply with the directive of an authority and/or court;\n\n\n(b)  Gcore has grounds for suspecting that Customer is committing any illegal or unlawful act in connection with the use of Services;\n\n\n(c)  if Customer is in default with its payment obligations, and/or\n\n\n(d)  any other provision within this Agreement or Service Order allows Gcore to suspend provision of all or any of Services.\n\n\n16.2  If any Services are suspended as a consequence of Customer's act or omission, (i) Customer shall remain liable to pay the respective Fees as if Services had been properly provided by Gcore, and (ii) Customer shall reimburse Gcore for any additional charges and expenses incurred due to the suspension and/or recommencement of Services.\n\n\n16.3  Upon suspension of the Services or termination of the Agreement (or any Service Order) for any reason, Gcore may cease to provide all Services immediately, and shall be entitled to permanently erase any and all Customer Content or Customer Data after 30 calendar days from the date of suspension of the Services or termination of the Agreement, unless a shorter period is specified in the Services Specification or any other Gcore documentation. Gcore shall be also entitled to immediately erase Customer Content or Customer Data to implement subsection 3.2 or enforce other rights available under this Agreement or applicable law.\n\n",
      "\n17.1  During the Term, Gcore may publicize the existence of the relationship between the Parties for the purpose of its marketing activities. Subject to the foregoing, neither Party shall make any press announcements concerning the Agreement or publicize the Agreement in any way without the prior written consent of the other Party.\n\n\n17.2  All notices, requests, approvals, consents and other communications required or permitted herein will be in writing and in English. Either Party may change its contact information upon notice to the other Party. For clarity, if a notice is not received because the receiving Party has failed to notify the other Party per the preceding sentence or because receipt is refused, such notice nonetheless will be deemed to have been conclusively made seven (7) Days after delivery was reasonably initiated.\n\n\n17.3  If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or contrary to law, such holding will not render the Agreement unenforceable or contrary to law as a whole, and, in such event, such provision will be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provisions within the limits of applicable law.\n\n\n17.4  Neither Party may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, without the other Party’s express prior consent except that Gcore may freely assign any and all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (a) to a parent or Affiliate or (b) in connection with a Change of Control. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of all permitted successors and assigns. Unless expressly permitted in writing by Gcore, Customer may not assign, transfer, distribute, resell, lease or otherwise provide access to the Gcore Services to any third party.\n\n\n17.5  Each Party acknowledges that the Services, Confidential Information, hardware, software, technology, devices or other materials or information obtained from or provided to the other Party under this Agreement may be protected under, and subject to, import and export control laws of the European Union, its member states, or the United States, as well as those of equivalent in other jurisdictions; accordingly, their use, import, export and reexport, may be restricted, prohibited or necessitate securing licenses. Each Party agrees not to directly or indirectly export, re-export or cause to be exported or re-exported, any such Services, Confidential Information, hardware, software, technology, device or other such materials or information to any destination or entity prohibited or restricted under the laws of the European Union, its member states, or of the United States, or other respective jurisdictions, unless it will have first obtained express prior consent of the applicable agency or governmental body. Should Gcore reasonably determine that it cannot perform its obligations under this Agreement due to sanctions-related prohibitions, Gcore may terminate this Agreement effective immediately. Customer agrees to permit Gcore to use  information including, but not limited to, business name, place of incorporation, beneficial owners, and/or directors for the purposes of sanctions screening. For avoidance of doubt, ability or act to screen does not remove any obligation and/or liability within this Agreement. Gcore may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect, if Customer breaches subsection 17.5 or, if continued performance by Gcore of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement would breach or risk exposure to adverse consequences under sanctions or export controls. If Gcore terminates this Agreement pursuant to this clause, it shall not be obliged to make any payments, indemnify, or otherwise have any obligations or liabilities to Customer subsequent to the termination of this Agreement.\n\n\n17.6  This Agreement, the Services Specifications, the SLA, the AUP, other policies  and documentation viewable at  https://gcore.com/ and all Service Orders as well as other documents between the Parties are incorporated herein by reference, constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to its subject matter and supersede all other prior or contemporaneous representations, understandings or agreements; and there are no other representations, understandings or agreements between the Parties relative to such subject matter.\n\n\n17.7  From time to time this Agreement, including all Services Specifications, the SLA and the AUP can be modified by Gсore. Such modifications will not apply retroactively. The Customer will receive notification of any changes via email or a notice within their Gсore account.\n\n\n17.8  If there is an irreconcilable conflict between the terms and conditions of the Agreement and any other documents referenced herein, the conflict will be resolved in the following order of precedence: (a) this Agreement; (b) Services Specification; (c) SLA; (d) AUP; and (e) other documents. If a provision of this Service Order conflicts with the aforementioned documents, those documents will take precedence, unless the conflicting provision in the Service Order explicitly amends Agreement, the Services Specification, the SLA or the AUP respectively.\n\n\n17.9  This Agreement and any Service Order hereunder shall be governed by the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, without regard to International Private Law. All disputes arising out of or in connection with the present contract shall be finally settled under the Rules of arbitration of the Arbitration Center of the Luxembourg Chamber of Commerce by three (3) arbitrators appointed in accordance with said rules. Each Party waives any objection (on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction, forum non conveniens or otherwise) to the exercise of such jurisdiction over it by any such courts.",

      "Because we have our own infrastructure. If you’re streaming a 10-minute video, you can encode it for free to show it in a variety of formats and qualities.\n\n\nOur servers are installed in data centers all over the world, which gives us our own video encoding, CDN pops, cloud instances, and storage for video hosting. See our network map. We have been working on video for a long time, so we know how to configure it optimally using all of our infrastructure’s features.",
      "We prepare multi-bitrate encoding to ensure that your video is broadcasted over the Internet with any quality of bandwidth and for playback on any device.\n\n\nEnd users will have the following video qualities: LQ, SD, HD, and Full HD of horizontal or vertical (mobile) video.\n\n\nThe length of the stream or video must not exceed 48 hours.",
      "Feel free to stream vertical video from mobile devices as any other type of video: horizontal or even square",
      "Firstly, because it is as clear as possible to our customers. The size of live streams or VOD files may be unknown or highly dependent on encoding settings, but the length of the video is constant and always clear to you.\n\n\nRemember that we transcode for free, and all final multi-bitrates are stored with us for free, too. In this case, it would be wrong to charge for storage. Moreover, storage includes video, audio, metadata, thumbnails, and screenshots.",
      "No, we no longer store the original files. This option is only available upon request to the corporate clients. \nInstead you can use downloading of transcoded qualities (sd, hd, fhd) in MP4 in progressive download format.",
      "Yes, for now. We can attach your S3-like storage. In that case, no free transcoding will be applied. We’d be interested in understanding your use case.",
      "Video delivery is organized by our own CDN infrastructure. CDN counts the viewing time of each user. This is much easier for clients than counting traffic in gigabytes.\n\n\nPay attention to the features of common video players. If a player downloads a video segment to buffer, it’s considered delivered and paid. For example, if a player buffers 30 seconds of video before playing, then CDN must deliver those 30 seconds regardless of whether it is viewed by a viewer or the viewer simply closes the video player at the start.",
      "Yes, you can use your CDN’s packets. This is especially important for clients who distribute videos and other content. Please ask the support team to attach it to your account.",
      "Every month every user gets up to 50K minutes at no cost for video calls.\n\nWe count each user’s viewing time. If real-time communication lasts 20 minutes and there are 10 people in it, there will be 200 minutes in billing.\n\n\nFor passive webinar viewers, the “Webinar viewer” option with a reduction factor is automatically applied.\n",
      "We keep counting the length of the original video analyzed. If the analysis fires a conditional stop trigger, the trigger time is considered, not the length of the full video.\n\n\nImages are counted as 1 second.",
      "You need to activate the “Continuous stream transcoding” option. Then you can stream 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year or more with no limits, such as with TV/OTT broadcasting and CCTV live streams. This is available for live streams only.",
      "You need to activate the same “2K”, “4K”, or “8K” video encoding options.",
      "For popular settings, you can activate the corresponding options, such as “H.265/HEVC” or “4K”.\n\n\nIf you need additional custom settings, for example, to modify a preset, remove an unnecessary quality, or add extra low quality, just ask us. We’ll do it for you. Feel free to ask us to activate AV1, H.266, HEVC Main 4:4:4 12 profile, etc.",
      "Yes, we count all streaming features by time in seconds. Then we add up the seconds, and the final count is given in minutes.",
      "We can offer volume discounts and discounts for non-profit organizations.\n\n\nIf you plan to stream more than 1 million minutes per month, are switching from other providers, or need custom SLAs, please ask us.",

      "The easiest way is to drag-and-drop the video to our Control Panel. Any marketing person with no developer experience can do that (for example, if your marketing team is responsible for populating your application content).\nWe do the rest – video will be transcoded into different bitrates and delivered via our CDN. You need to copy-paste iframe of the player with the video and embed it in the web-application (or just pass the code to your developers)\nFollow this step-by-step guide to learn more about Control Panel settings.",

      "We can transcode into anything you need.\nBasic options are AAC for audio and H264 for video, of course. We don’t charge for transcoding in the basic options. Read more on the transcoding formats here.",

Which means our edge servers share loads between each other and that viewers are separated between lots of servers based on:",
      "And if one server is out of work for any reason, traffic will be re-routed to another server in the same cluster. That means viewers will never have to wait for the video to be played.",
      "Video transcoding is free. You won’t be charged for that.\nWhat you will pay for:",
      "For example, if you have 3 videos, with each of them 5 mins in length.\nAnd each of these 3 videos are watched by 10 viewers from the beginning to the end.\nUploaded minutes: 3videos * 5minutes * € 0.003 = € 0.045.\nWatching minutes: 3videos * 10viewers * 5minutes * € 0.001 = € 0.15.",
      "We charge per month, so you’ll be charged for the maximum of uploaded minutes. That means if you upload 5 minutes on the 1st day of the month and 10 minutes on the 2nd day, and then stop uploading – you’ll be charged for 15 mins at the end of the month. If you upload 5 minutes on the 1st day of the month, then delete these 5 minutes immediately (it was the wrong video or a test). Then the next day you upload 10 minutes and that was all for the rest of the month – you’ll be charged for 10 minutes, as this is the maximum amount you have for the month.",
      "As far as per-minute pricing for the time viewers watch your video – it fully depends on your consumption. You don’t pay for more than your viewers watched.",
